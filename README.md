# Artagdoll-Sfx
basically an addon that will let you remplace all the sfx for the artagdoll mod on gmod.

-- how to make it work in game --

First, make sure the the base Artagdoll Sfx addon is disabled, because its may override the sounds.

Once you remplaced all the audio files, make sure you only leave the folder "AADSFX" folder in your addon folder of gmod.
Do not change the name of any folder !!
